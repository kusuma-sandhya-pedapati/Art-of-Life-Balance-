# Art-of-Life-Balance-
stacey shipman said see saw is the best metaphor for life balance.
UPS AND DOWNS-like the see saw, life comes with ups and downs,happiness and sadness.a person would prefer happiness over sadness ,but truth is both are part of life.
we have to experience both ups and downs,then only we can experience and enjoy life.
IT'S FUN FOR A WHILE,BUT THEN WE NEED A BREAK-even if it is fun playing seesaw but we need break because of tiredness after sometime, in the same way after experiencing many ups and downs we need to take break for a while like going on holiday
LET IT FLOW-trying to find balance in see saw is hard,in the same way we try so hard to find balance and gain control but this need for control creates more stress and imbalance.
But when we allow ourselves to simply let it flow we will be more at ease

how to balance life effortlesly in words of avani mehta-
BE CLEAR OF YOUR PRIORITIES-being clear of priorities means finding out what is important in which order,separate the essentials from non-essentials.
the lesser things you have got on your plate, the easier it will be to balance them.
STAND FOR YOURSELF-no matter how many rules you follow if you don't stand for yourself all the rules you followed become useless.
you should be able to make our own decisions because no one knows your priorities,commitments better than you.
you should be able to be responsible, and also should learn how to say no.
RANDOM TIPS AND IDEAS-
start small,don't plan to transform your entire life in one shot.go slow and steady.
pick up what seems easy enough to implement first.see positive results,gain confidence and then move to difficult ones.
have patience,it takes time to achieve great things.
