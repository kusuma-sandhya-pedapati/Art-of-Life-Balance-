# Art-of-Life-Balance-
stacey shipman said see saw is the best metaphor for life balance.
UPS AND DOWNS-like the see saw, life comes with ups and downs,happiness and sadness.a person would prefer happiness over sadness ,but truth is both are part of life.
we have to experience both ups and downs,then only we can experience and enjoy life.
IT'S FUN FOR A WHILE,BUT THEN WE NEED A BREAK-even if it is fun playing seesaw but we need break because of tiredness after sometime, in the same way after experiencing many ups and downs we need to take break for a while like going on holiday
LET IT FLOW-trying to find balance in see saw is hard,in the same way we try so hard to find balance and gain control but this need for control creates more stress and imbalance.
But when we allow ourselves to simply let it flow we will be more at ease
